# Presentations

This repository collects a set of talks I’ve given at security conferences and corporate settings over the past few years. The presentations focus on defensive security topics, malware behavior, attacker techniques, and real-world threat activity, with a mix of technical depth and practical context. All material is based on public information, research, and hands-on analysis.
