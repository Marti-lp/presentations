# Presentations

This repository collects a set of talks I’ve given at security conferences and corporate settings over the past few years. The presentations focus on defensive security topics, malware behavior, attacker techniques, and real-world threat activity, with a mix of technical depth and practical context. All material is based on public information, research, and hands-on analysis.

This README is written in English to make the content accessible to a broader audience, but all slides were presented in Spanish.

## Topics covered
Across these talks, I explore topics such as:
- How modern defensive technologies work under the hood
- Malware behavior and detection in real environments
- Threat intelligence and regional trends in LATAM
- Ransomware attack chains and attacker tradecraft
- The human factor in security and social engineering


## Content

### Social Engineering: Are We That Predictable?
- **Nerdearla 2022**
- **Audience:** General
An overview of social engineering from its origins to present-day attacks.  
The talk looks at well-known cases, the principles behind social engineering, and how human behavior plays a central role in techniques like phishing.

### Malware in LATAM: The Real Picture
- **Nerdearla 2023**
- **Audience:** Technical
- **Language:** Spanish (slides)

A look at the malware landscape in Latin America, focusing on how antivirus detections are interpreted and what they can (and can’t) tell us.  
It covers detection trends across the region, common malware families, file types, reported vulnerabilities, and attacker TTPs, along with regional case studies such as VictoryGate (Peru), Operation Absolute (Colombia), and banking trojans in South America.

### How Antivirus Software Works
- **Ekoparty 2024**
- **Audience:** Technical
This talk walks through the evolution of cyberattacks and defensive tools, and then dives into how modern antivirus solutions actually work at a low level.  
It covers topics such as UEFI protections, malware DNA, memory analysis (syscalls, heap, stack, library loading), and the current challenges and promises of using AI for detection.

### Anatomy of a Ransomware Attack
- **Corporate presentation, 2025**
- **Audience:** Security practitioners
This talk breaks down a typical ransomware attack from start to finish, using real-world data from the region.  
Topics include initial access via phishing or exploits, delivery through droppers and modular malware, persistence and lateral movement using native Windows features and living-off-the-land techniques, data exfiltration and extortion, RaaS models, and the growing role of AI in ransomware operations.
